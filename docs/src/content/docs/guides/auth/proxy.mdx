title: "Auth: Proxy (Overview)"
description: "High‑level notes about using your own proxy for Deepgram and other providers."
---

This is a brief overview. We recommend starting with ephemeral tokens first.

Why a proxy?

- Keep API keys strictly server‑side.
- Normalize provider differences and apply rate limiting or logging.
- Work around REST CORS when needed.

Caveats

- WebSocket proxying can be limited on some serverless platforms; verify your host supports WS upgrade.
- A proxy must set `Authorization` for upstream requests (e.g. `Token <API_KEY>` for Deepgram) and should not accept arbitrary client headers.

Status

- We plan to publish a concrete proxy guide with code once we finish internal validation. For now, use the Ephemeral Tokens guide for browsers.
